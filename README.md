- 👋 Hi, I’m @LinusOlofsson
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning and image analysis for sawmills, specifically using X-ray computed tomography data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about neural networks, specifically physics-informed NNs, to capture the details of growing knots and their appearances in 3D CT data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything regarding the above topics.
- 📫 You can reach me at linus.olofsson@ltu.se
